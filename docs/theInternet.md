## The Internet is Hard

Yes, The Internet is Hard. The Internet is the only place we can create something once, and have it distributed the entire world in purpituity. That means that The Internet is also where the most inspired works from both the living and deceased can easily be accessed by everyone. That means, To engage on The Internet is to compete with them directly for attention. It is easy to apprecaite this and then resolve to the notion of incompentance. The Internet is hard.
