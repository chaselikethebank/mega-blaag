# Why ?!
## Current State
In a sea of people and resources, standards media messaging, and design systems can experience friction, noise and chaos. 

## Solution
Lets reduce friction and begin to scale. Lets move from brute force to leveraged agency -- 1:1 to 1:10. Let's do the hard work of designing the system once, printing it to production multiple times, and then circle back and make small ammendments. 

This guide is a quasi educational referential framework for all parties that operate in a client-facing role. This guide is to serve all teams and individuals despite their hierarchtical level or experience as they progress on the path of creatively serving at scale. 

## Future Growth
With this work as our tailwind, expect streamlined processes and accelerated growth in media, web development systems, and ?! that we can continue to build on in an agile and iterative way.
