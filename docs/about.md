# Getting Started

## Current State
It is an inevitability that in a growing organization with a sea of people and resources, standards, media messaging, and design systems can eventually evolve to experience friction, noise, and chaos. Sometimes, this manifests as technical debt, a lack of brand identity, or even important questions going unanswered. This style guide aims to address these issues and more by shifting from the micro, immediate, and local to the macro, long-term, and at scale.

## Proposal
How about this? Let's reduce the amount of friction and let's operate at the order of magnitude. Let's scale up! Let's move from brute force to leveraged agency — from 1:1 to 1:10. Let's do the hard work of designing the system once, repeatidly print to production, and then circle back to monitor the experience and results to make small amendments early and often.

As a quasi-educational referential framework for all parties operating in a client-facing role. It aims to serve all teams and individuals, irrespective of their hierarchical level or experience, as they progress on the path of creatively serving at scale.

## Future Growth
With this work as our tailwind, expect streamlined processes and accelerated growth in media, web development systems, and more — that we can continue to build on in an agile and iterative way. Working mental models across an organization to achieve product-market fit and fast. Onboarding individual media roles or campuses becomes a turn-key operation.
