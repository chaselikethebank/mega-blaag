# Getting Started



## Current State
Growing organization can experience friction, noise, and chaos. This manifests as technical debt, poor brand identity, or unanswered questions. What is the next step, the next level?  

## Proposal
This style guide aims to address these issues by shifting from what might feel like the micro, immediate, and local to the macro, long-term, and at scale.

 _Let's scale up!_ Let's move from brute force to leveraged agency â€” from 1:1 to 1:10. Let's do the hard work of designing the system once, repeatidly print to production, and then circle back to monitor the experience and results to make small amendments. Let's continually do this early and often.

Let's use this as a quasi-educational referential framework for all parties. Let's serve all teams and individuals, irrespective of their hierarchical level or experience, as they progress on the path of creatively serving at scale and on the next level.

## Expectations
With this work as our tailwind, expect streamlined processes and accelerated growth in media and frontend development systems. Expect these  mental models to evolve and sharpen to achieve product-market fit fast. Expect onboarding individual roles as well as campuses to become a turn-key operation.
