# Why
## Current State
In a sea of people and resources, standards, media messaging, and design systems can experience friction, noise, and chaos.

## Solution
Let's reduce friction and begin to scale. Let's move from brute force to leveraged agency — from 1:1 to 1:10. Let's do the hard work of designing the system once, printing it to production multiple times, and then circle back and make small amendments.

This guide is a quasi-educational referential framework for all parties operating in a client-facing role. It serves all teams and individuals, irrespective of their hierarchical level or experience, as they progress on the path of creatively serving at scale.

## Future Growth
With this work as our tailwind, expect streamlined processes and accelerated growth in media, web development systems, and more — that we can continue to build on in an agile and iterative way.
