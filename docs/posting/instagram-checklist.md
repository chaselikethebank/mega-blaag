### Steps

When to move forward 
- stuck in a hierarchy and the glass cieling is real

## Vision

If you can see the end goal in clarity despite how far off in the distance it is. 

## Process

If you can articulate the steps to get there to such a fine degree. 

Scene: 
The path to success is like traverse a lava flow by jumping rock to rock. Think, Littlefoot in "The Land Before Time" (1988). 

How is your ability to plan, recognize potential blind spots and solve them beforehand? 

It is common to partake on a vision (in ignorance) only to get cooked in a lava flow. 

## Discernment 

What happens when the vision and the process stop working. Think, the ship of Theseus's. More than, "when is it Theseus's?" or whatever, think... "Can I build an entirely new ship while at sea?" Note: much more limit resources compared to building a sea on land for example. 

Can you lick your fingers, hold them up into the air and say, "The wind has changed", and with confidence convince your team to also see the change and understand how with a new vision and process to move forward with reckless abandonment? 

These are the characteristics of an individual who is ready to start a journey as a leader. If you do not possess them currently, how do you build these skills? 

Well, you have to engage in the journey of leadership. You kind of have to learn just how far you can jump from stone to stone and that might me getting cooked in the lava flow. Not everyone can be a first round draft pick. 

Next question is when. 

Like the japanese parable, "When is the best time to plant a tree? 20 years ago. Or, today."

When is the best time to start on the path? 20 years ago. Or, today.
