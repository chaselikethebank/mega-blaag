# the work vs _The Work_
Managing all elements of a brand's media is challenging. Coordinating a  campaign and executing on a strategy can feel overwhelming but it is possible. What is impossible is to do the strategic work of system build as well as the craft work of the results of those systems all at the same time. 

**You cannot build an airplane mid-flight.**


## Pain Point - Frontend

Designing a landing page with a 4 column grid vs building a design system of 4 column grid to be used for a multy-facited organization.

```css
 .grid-4 {
    display: grid;
    gap: 1rem;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(calc(25% - 1rem), 1fr));
}

@media (max-width: 992px) {
    .grid-4{
        grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(calc(50% - 1rem), 1fr));
    }
}

@media (max-width: 576px) {
    .grid-4{

## Task
Seperate the media strategies from the media dissimenation process. Define the media strategies.  

## Action
Implementing a structured template or framework for each step offers considerable relief from this burden.

## Result

Product-Market fit

If we can answer these questions we might have a chance. What direction we are facing? What agendas we are pursueing? What is the ROAS? What about this approach is/isn't working?

:::tip Competition is Healthy   
Media and marketing is an ever evolving discipline. Our peers do an incredible job in recognizing when an edge has been generated, reverse-engineering said advantage, and implemnting it for themselves erroding our edge. Let's stay on  the offense and continue to aggrigate gains even if on the margins.  

Let's stay agile!
