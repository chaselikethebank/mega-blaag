## Do's 
| Aphorism                                         | Explanation                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 💰 **Educators are Overpaid**                             | Sharing knowledge is sharing value. Your audience will reimburse you with their attention.|
| 🎥  **Hollywooding**                      | By elevating others you qualify your voice as one of authority. Watch two actors talk about how wonderful each other are. In a loop. That is how a star is born.|
| 🗣️ **Clarity is King**                             | Distill the message to the essentials. ...then again. |
| ⏳ **FOMO**                      | Drive urgency and demand by leveraging scarcity. **Be careful not to negate the frame**|
| 🔨 **Make Loops**                        | Assume audiences are new. Repeat stories intentionally; forge lasting impressions. |
| 📣 **Call to Action** | Every post, every page, every touch point should engage the audience to do something right now. |
| 🖼️ **Perspective**    | Copy written in the first person has the least friction. "Hey, I am signing up today!." - The person on camera / the copywritter themself **Tread lightly as this is very difficult to do authentically.** |
| 🏐 **Serve and Volley** | To engage is reply to everyone in a way that solicits an additional reply |
| ⚡ **Emotion is Contagious** | Display happy, transmit happy. Display sad, transmit sad. Because high-energy is the fuel for action, we display high-energy to transmit high-energy. |


## Don'ts

| Aphorism                      | Explanation                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🖌️ **Negate the Frame**      | Refrain from emphasizing undesirables. Articulate positive messaging and desired actions. For example, "You don't want to **MISS THIS EVENT**" puts the focus on what exactly? |
| 📅 **Say Goodbye** | In sales, you never end a meeting without booking the next meeting. Refrain from saying, "Goodbye". Bottom of the page => CTA. End of campaign => Top of funnel |
