# Media is hard

## Pain Point
Managing all elements of a brand's media is challenging. Coordinating a substantial campaign and adhering to a set strategy can feel overwhelming and is in fact impossible to do both the strategic work and the posting work at the same time. 

## Task
Seperate the media strategies from the media dissimenation process. Define the media strategies.  

## Action
Implementing a structured template or framework for each step offers considerable relief from this burden.





## Result

Product-Market fit

:::tip Media is hard  
Media and marketing is an ever evolving discipline. Our peers do an incredible job in recognizing when an edge has been generated, reverse-engineering said advantage, and implemnting it for themselves erroding our edge. Let's stay on  the offense and continue to aggrigate gains even if on the margins.  

Let's stay agile!
