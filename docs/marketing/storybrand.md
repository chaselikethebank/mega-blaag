# StoryBrand Framework

## Hero Messaging
- Make customer the hero of the story

### Affirmative statement to know you are on the right track:
    - “____ is exactly what my customer is inspired/motivated by, but haven’t acted on yet?”

## Guide Positioning
- Yourself, Product, or service is the guide through the Hero's(think customer’s) journey  

### Affirmative statement to know you are on the right track:
    - “My offering ignites and guides my customer through the next step of their journey.”

## Clarity
- If you confuse, you lose! 
- The message should be as sharp as an ice pick and able to push through all the noise. 

### Affirmative statement to know you are on the right track:
    
- “With zero previous context, I have fully engaged my customer 1:1 and they know exactly what low-friction actions to take to interface with my offering."
